#Apple Picker

I made the following additions after following the tutorial from chapter 30 of "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development":

-A start screen with a start button

-A fourth basket

-UI that tells the player what round they are in

-A game over screen with a restart button

-A branch that the player should avoid catching
